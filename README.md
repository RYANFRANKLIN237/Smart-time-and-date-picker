# Smart-time-and-date-picker
This Flutter project showcases a powerful and user-friendly date and time picker designed with efficiency and clarity in mind.


# key Features:

- **Intelligent date selection:**  Restricts selectable dates to Monday-Saturday, ensuring appointments or deliveries never land on Sundays.
- **Time-bound selection:**  Limits selectable times to a specific range (e.g., 9:00 AM to 7:00 PM), streamlining workflows and scheduling within business hours.
- **Intuitive UI:** Provides a clean and responsive calendar and time picker interface for a smooth user experience.
- **Reactive with Getx:** Leverages GetX state management for a reactive architecture, simplifying data flow and reducing boilerplate code.
- **Robust Error handling:** Displays a clear error snackbar when users attempt to select unavailable times, preventing confusion.
- **MVC Design pattern:** Employs the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern for well-structured and maintainable code.
